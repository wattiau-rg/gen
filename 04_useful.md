<h4>Speeches and more</h4>
We are very keen to incorporate British and French traditions in our wedding. So in addition to the wedding toasts, we will be having what the French call "animations, hon, hon". They are short pieces - sketches, song, musicals, games, videos etc. - prepared by willing guests for the bride, the grooms and the other guests. If you are keen to so, please contact Joël Gay (joel.gay01+gwed(at)gmail.com).

<h4>Should I make a week-end of it?</h4>

Definitely! There are plenty of <a href="https://www.breconbeacons.org/things-to-do" target="_blank">places to see and visit</a> as well as <a href="https://www.breconbeacons.org/where-to-stay" target="_blank">very nice accomodation</a> in the National Park.

<h4>How are you going to handle a trilingual wedding?</h4>
We would love to incorporate elements of both our Welsh and French cultures into our wedding day, though this seems easier for some things (e.g. food) than for others (e.g  wine, and anything involving language)! On the day, you can expect to hear English, French and Welsh spoken. During the ceremony, most of the “official” bits will take place in English, but the Welsh and French languages will be represented via other contributions. We will provide written translations in the order of service so you can follow what’s going on in your own language.

<h4>What should I prepare for?</h4>
As with everywhere in the UK, you can never make any guarantees about the weather! 
In practice, the weather is generally fairly mild here in April, though rain is always a possibility. The mean maximum daily temperature in Wales is just over 13°C, but this does vary quite a lot - in 2018, the max temperature was around 20-25°C. Given this, it’s a good idea to be prepared (something to cover your shoulders, if not a coat, and an umbrella). From our point of view, Rebecca has prepared a removable fleece lining for her dress, sunglasses, a white bridal pac-a-mac, and some suitably fetching wellies in a bid to cover all the bases (not least of which will be style). If you’re as fascinated by data as the bride is and want to be ultra-prepared, you can see some lovely April weather charts on the Met Office website.

All paths around the church and the village hall are paved, and parking is available within 100-200m, so you shouldn’t have to walk any long distances or wade through any mud. These options remain open to you should you wish to find a nearby field. If you intend to get involved in the dancing (and we hope you will!) you may wish to select appropriate footwear for hopping, skipping, and swinging your partner in a lively manner (or opt to remove your shoes come the evening - no judgement here).
