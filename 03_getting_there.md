<h4>By car</h4>
There are two roads that will get you in to Crickhowell. One is the A40 on the road from Abergavenny to Brecon, the other is the aptly named Crickhowell Road, aka the A4077 from Gilwern (coming off the A465).
Parking is available in the High School car park, just across the road from the church gate.
There is also plenty of parking available opposite the village hall in Llangynidr when it comes to the reception.

If you’re taking a car and have a spare seat or two, we’d be really grateful if you could let us know via the RSVP form, as we may be able to arrange lift shares. Our grandchildren will thank you.

<h4>By train</h4>
The nearest train station to Crickhowell is Abergavenny, which is about a 15 minute drive away. A taxi from the station is probably your best bet. Feel free to let us know via the contact form if you are relying on public transport, and we’ll do our best to pair you up with a four-wheeled guest, or put you in touch with other guests so you can share a taxi. Please note that Uber has not yet reached Abergavenny, and it is advisable to book taxis in advance! 

It's also worth noting that the trains don’t run hugely late around here! We’ve put some accommodation information on the site in case you’d like to make a weekend of it (that way we get to enjoy even more time with you!).

<h4>From further afield</h4>
If you’re travelling in from France there are a few options available to you:

The nearest airports are Cardiff and Bristol (both have direct flights from Paris CDG, and are just over an hour’s drive from Abergavenny). There are public transport links from the airport into the city, and then trains from Cardiff and Bristol to Abergavenny.

The Eurostar will take you from Paris into London. A train from London to Abergavenny takes about 2½ - 3 hours.

If you’re planning on bringing a car, the shuttle will take you to Folkestone, which is about a 4 hour drive from Abergavenny. Ferry routes include Calais to Dover (4 hours drive from Abergavenny), or Caen/Le Havre to Portsmouth (2¾ - 3 hours drive from Abergavenny).
