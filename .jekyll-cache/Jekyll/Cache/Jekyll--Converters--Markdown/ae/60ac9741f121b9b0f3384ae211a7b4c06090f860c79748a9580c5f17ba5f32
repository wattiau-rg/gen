I"Ü<p>We are happy to invite you to celebrate our marriage with us. The ceremony will take place in &lt;a href=â€https://goo.gl/maps/WJeW6gKCzVGUh4BV7â€get=â€_blankâ€&gt; St Edmundâ€™s Church&lt;/a&gt;, Crickhowell on the 24<sup>th</sup> of March 2019 at 1 pm. This will be the most important part of our wedding day, during which we will commit ourselves to one another before God, our family and our friends. The wedding will take place in St. Edmundâ€™s church in Crickhowell, the church Rebecca and her family have called home for the last 20+ years. Our faith is a central part of both our lives, and will be the foundation of our life as a couple, so our aim is to reflect this in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The service should last around an hour. During this time, as well as the â€œI dosâ€, we will praise God by singing together, by hearing readings from the Bible, as well a short address, and by praying for Rebecca and GaÃ«tan as they start their married life. In the â€œmarriageâ€ part of the service, we will make our vows to one another, and will exchange rings as a visual reminder of the promises weâ€™ve made. You can find more information about what exactly weâ€™re signing ourselves up for on the Church in Wales website.</p>
