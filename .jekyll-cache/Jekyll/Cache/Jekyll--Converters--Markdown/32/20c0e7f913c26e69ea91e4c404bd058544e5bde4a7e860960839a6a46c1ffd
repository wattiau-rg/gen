I"¥<h4>By car</h4>
<p>There are two roads that will get you in to Crickhowell. One is the A40 on the road from Abergavenny to Brecon, the other is the aptly named Crickhowell Road, aka the A4077 from Gilwern (coming off the A465).
Parking is available in the High School car park, just across the road from the church gate.
There is also plenty of parking available opposite the village hall in Llangynidr when it comes to the reception.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re taking a car and have a spare seat or two, weâ€™d be really grateful if you could let us know via the contact form, as we may be able to arrange lift shares. Our grandchildren will thank you.

<h4>By train</h4>
<p>The nearest train station to Crickhowell is Abergavenny, which is about a 15 minute drive away. There is a bus service linking the two but itâ€™s not the most regular so if you areopting for the public transport option, a taxi from the station is probably your best bet. Let us know via the contact form if you could do with a lift, and weâ€™ll do our best to pair you up with a four-wheeled guest, or put you in touch with other guests so you can share a taxi.
