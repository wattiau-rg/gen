We are delighted to be able to share our wedding day with you, our friends and family, and to have you at our side as we step into married life. Your love, prayers and friendship are truly the greatest gifts we could ask for as a couple.<br>

As some of you have already kindly asked if you can contribute something to our new home, we have set up a gift registry with John Lewis. You can access it by <a href="https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/giftint/JSPs/GiftList/BuyGifts/GuestFindAList.jsp" target="_blank">clicking on this link.</a><br>

The number of our gift registry is 782429. It is open now until around 2 weeks after the wedding. There are three ways of purchasing an item from the list: <a href="https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/giftint/JSPs/GiftList/BuyGifts/GuestFindAList.jsp" target="_blank">online</a>; over the phone; or in store.<br>

As many of you will know, we are still fairly mobile housing-wise, but are hoping to set up a more permanent base soon. If you would prefer to give a cash gift, we will put this either towards some larger items which we will not be buying straight away (e.g. white goods) or towards some more bespoke items (from local craftsmen where possible) which will help us build our home. We will also donate a proportion of the total to charity.<br>
If you would prefer to do this via online transfer, the account details are:<br>
Sort code: 40-14-13 Account number: 23939219<br>
Please don't forget to put your name in the reference so we can thank you!
