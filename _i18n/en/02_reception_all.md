After the wedding ceremony, please join us in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pQNvSBXcm5WxEPhc9" target="_blank">Llangynidr Village Hall</a> for a canap√© reception and wedding breakfast. This will be followed by a twmpath (a Welsh ceilidh) in the evening, with finger food and even more dancing later on.

Please let us know of any dietary requirements via the RSVP form.
