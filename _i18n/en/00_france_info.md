We are getting officially married in Wales on the 18<sup>th</sup> of April 2020 but we are also organising a casual blessing ceremony and reception in France. We want to use this as an opportunity to thank God and ask for his blessings and to get together with our friends and family to celebrate.
<br><br>
The celebrations in France will take place in the afternoon of the <b>4<sup>th</sup> of July 2020</b> in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/u3GSFEQWVok4ie2u8" target="_blank">Genainville</a>.
<br><br>
We will update this website with more info as the celebrations in France get organised. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach to us with questions.
