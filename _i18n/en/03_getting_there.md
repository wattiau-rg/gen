<h4>By car</h4>
There are two roads that will get you in to Crickhowell. One is the A40 on the road from Abergavenny to Brecon, the other is the aptly named Crickhowell Road, aka the A4077 from Gilwern (coming off the A465).
Parking is available in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fyCu72SiyPQVkGt38" target="_blank">High School car park</a>, just across the road from the church gate.
There is also plenty of parking available opposite the village hall in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yNKXqo35Jp3dwGtZA" target="_blank">Llangynidr</a> when it comes to the reception.

<h4>By train</h4>
The nearest train station is Abergavenny, which is about a 15 minute drive from Crickhowell. A taxi from the station is probably your best bet. Feel free to let us know via the contact form if you are relying on public transport, and we’ll do our best to pair you up with a four-wheeled guest, or put you in touch with other guests so you can share a taxi. Please note that Uber has not yet reached Abergavenny, and it is advisable to book taxis in advance! 

It's also worth noting that the trains don’t run hugely late around here! We’ve put some accommodation information on the site in case you’d like to make a weekend of it (that way we get to enjoy even more time with you!).
